This is my first training project - a simple **layout of the site**. Here I used only **HTML and CSS**, used **flexbox**. The purpose of this work was to learn how properly make the layout of website's blocks, to pass the **validation** without errors and warnings, to **optimize all images** and make the site **adaptive** for mobile phone, tablet and desktop. The site is **adaptive**.
